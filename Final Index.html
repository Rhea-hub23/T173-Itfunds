   1.) My Learnings in each lessons <br><br>
    a. Roles and Oppurtunities of Information Technology in meeting sustainability challenges:
     
     Information Technology plays a massive role in making our lives easier and fast. by collecting data and sharing it to different people across the world. 
     <br>
     It exposes students to the operating system, input devices, output devices and storage units and their interrelationships. The course also introduces students to the use of the computer for processing of data and searching information on the internet.
     <br>
      The computer receives input, processes the input as per user instructions and provides output and can be stored in a desired format. Computer input is called data and the output obtained after processing it, is called information.    <br>
      Computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media.
   it is a goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery. It includes the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes, and development of both hardware and software. <br>  Computing technology is ubiquitous, in the form of computers, tablets, smartphones, the web, cloud computing, email, text messages, social media, and much more. Computing technology is centrally relevant in the careers and lives of increasingly more people.

     <br>
     b. History of Computers:<br>
     when it was first invented by Charles Babbage and how it evolve through the years and how the Mobile phone came to life which mostly became the center of most transactions and data exchange.
     <br>
     The word 'compute' comes from the Latin word computare, meaning "arithmetic, accounting, reckoning". Clearly, its meaning has been extended to include non-numerical "reckoning". The Latin word computare itself comes from: Latin com, meaning "with", and.Five early calculating devices are: Abacus Pascaline, Napier's Bones, Difference Engine, and Analytical engine.
     <br><br>
     c. HTML, CSS and JavaScript: <br>
     that led me to tears just like computer programming, hehehhe 
     but it's a bit easy to understand than the C programming, though there are a lot to memorize to use the codes efficiently and correctly. TvT

         The only one I can say I am proud to have is my mother, I can draw, play instruments, cook, sing, talk, play, live because she is there, though we are not perfect because we only have each other to complete a whole but together we are more than enough.
         Yes sometimes we argue but we don't end the day until we're okey.
